# Z2edit for Zelda II Randomizer 4.4

This is a modified z2edit to:
- View palaces in Z2R 4.4
- Edit palace rooms easier, working directly with PalaceRooms.json
  - Sideview data can be copied into a field, and hit enter to re-create that room. When you are satisfied with the changes, press Commit to ROM to update the copy-paste-field, then copy that hex string back to PalaceRooms.json.
  - The same works for the enemy tab in the Sideview Editor.
